# Black Jack Game
Hello everyone!
This is a simple black jack game that I've created to improve my object oriented programming.

Currently: 
Two player game (Player and Dealer).
Dealer and player have randomized hand, dealer won't stop till he either beats a player or reaches 21.
If Ace is drawn and the hand is over 21 the Ace is autmatically converted to 1; it applies to one Ace any additional Ace still holds 11 value till over 21 is reacher. 
The classes and functions are named to give modifier an ability to understand the actions without going through the code.

Included:
✔️Possibility to add additional player, with minor modifications
✔️Dealer/Player bust
✔️Ability to restart

Known issues:
❌If the full deck will be drawn (52 cards) the code will crash
❌Terminal based UI

There are no plans on further improving the following code.

Possible areas of improvement:
❓Adding additional players and creating AI to predict the probably of being bust; taking low risk high reward routs to a win.
